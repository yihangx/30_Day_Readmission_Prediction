The MIMIC-III database has been used to research many applications of machine learning in the years since it has been released, and led to many research publications. Your task will be to draw upon this research and perform your own analysis, or to choose your own problem and solve it using methods you have learned in the class."

    "Both inpatient (during a hospital admission) and 30-day mortality are important measures which hospitals are graded on across the country. The rate at which mortality in the inpatient setting or within 30 days of admission are some key factors which can influence how well a hospital is perceived. Therefore, many hospitals are working to try and predict which patients die within a patient encounter or within 30 days of admission. If a patients' risk could be made available to a physician at key points during the encounter, a hospital may make certain decisions to try and mitigate the risk of a patient being counted against them, such as consulting palliative care or other administrative measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task:\n",
    "Using the data from the MIMIC-III dataset, create a machine learning model that predicts whether a patient will die within a hospital stay or within 30 days of a patient admission. When doing this, keep in mind *when* the model will be used. For example, if all of the data from the encounter is used to predict if a patient dies at the end of the encounter, then using that model in production may be too late, as the patient will have already died."

    "The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has placed an emphasis on [reducing 30-day readmissions](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/quality-initiatives-patient-assessment-instruments/hospitalqualityinits/outcomemeasures.html). 30-day readmissions are particularly bad because if a patient is sick enough to come back in 30-days, it is likely that they were not stable enough to discharge in the first place. Therefore, there are large financial penalties for having too many 30-day readmissions. \n",
    "\n",
    "One potential solution that may help solve this problem is to provide physicians with a list of patients that are at high risk of readmission each day, so that they can take special care of those patients and be cautious about discharging them too early.
